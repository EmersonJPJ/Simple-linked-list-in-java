# 🚗 **Vehicle Sorting with Singly Linked Lists** 🚗

## 🎯 Description

Welcome to an innovative project that implements a **vehicle sorting system** using **singly linked lists**! This project clearly demonstrates how to manage vehicles in an ordered list, all without relying on external libraries! 🚀

Through nodes, each vehicle is stored with essential details such as **brand** and **model**, and the system keeps them ordered efficiently. Manage your vehicles interactively!

## 📚 **Technical Features**

- **Data Structure**: Singly Linked List
  - Vehicles are stored in nodes containing **brand** and **model**.
  - The list remains automatically ordered by the **vehicle model**.
  
- **Programming Language**: **Java** 💻
  - **Classes and Objects**: Organizes data in structured classes.
  - **Exceptions**: Handles errors robustly for a smooth experience.

- **User Interface**:
  - **JOptionPane** is used for interactive input and output dialogs. 📲

## 🧩 **Available Operations**

Here are the powerful functionalities you can execute on your virtual vehicle list:

- **Add Vehicle**: Add vehicles to the list while maintaining order by **model**. 🆕
- **Remove Vehicle**: Delete specific vehicles by their model. ❌
- **Modify Vehicle**: Change the details of any vehicle. ✏️
- **Check Existence**: Search if a vehicle exists in the list. 🔍
- **Show List**: View all vehicles in the list, ordered. 📋
